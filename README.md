### NOTES APP
This is a notes app built with React that allows users to save different groups of notes, with all data being persistent.

### Features List:

1. The user can create a group for notes. A popup opens to create a new group, and if the user clicks outside the popup, it will close.
2. The user can add notes to a specific group.
3. The user can save a note by pressing the Enter key or clicking the Enter icon in the text input.
4. Notes are stored in local storage, and all notes and groups are persistent on page reload.
5. When the user switches groups, all notes related to the selected group are fetched.
6. This app also saves metadata, such as the date and time when notes were saved and last updated.
